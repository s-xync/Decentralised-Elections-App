# Decentralised-Elections-App
A decentralised web application or DAPP for conducting small scale elections.  
This is a code along project for the 2hr [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3681ZYbDSSk&t=3944s).  
Through out this tutorial, I have learnt a lot of Solidity and Javascript techniques that I have not known before when I was doing the project [Bloodeth](https://github.com/s-xync/Bloodeth).  
Previously, when I was doing Bloodeth, I did not know how to use Truffle framework and so, I had to cobble together information about how to put pieces together and deploy an app. I did deploy the app but I didnot use real software engineering methodologies and good programming practices while doing it.  
But now, I am confident that I can write better Dapps with the knowledge acquired throughout this tutorial.  
Other than truffle, this tutorial also teaches how to use Mocha and Chai to do unit testing which I think is cool.  

I highly recommend everyone checking out the tutorial mentioned above.  

**EDIT 1:** Addition to the previously mentioned videos, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADoRVVOSpI8) 22min video tutorial explains the process of making our Dapp, a fully decentralised Dapp by deploying the client side assets on IPFS(https://ipfs.io/). The _src_ directory and _build_ directory are added to the ipfs swarm and then published. After this, a client can directly access the Election app through IPFS instead of requesting a central server which means, no single point failures.  

YAY! Now I know how to use IPFS.  

Thanks!
