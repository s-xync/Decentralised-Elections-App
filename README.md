# Decentralised-Elections-App
A decentralised web application or DAPP for conducting small scale elections  
This is a code along project for the 2hr [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3681ZYbDSSk&t=3944s)  
Through out this tutorial, I have learnt a lot of Solidity and Javascript techniques that I have not known before when I was doing the project [Bloodeth](https://github.com/s-xync/Bloodeth)  
Previously, when I was doing Bloodeth, I did not know how to use Truffle framework and so, I had to cobble together information about how to put pieces together and deploy an app. I did deploy the app but I didnot use real software engineering methodologies and good programming practices while doing it.  
But now, I am confident that I can write better Dapps with the knowledge acquired throughout this tutorial.  
Other than truffle, this tutorial also teaches how to use Mocha and Chai to do unit testing which I think is cool.  

I highly recommend everyone checking out the tutorial mentioned above.
Thanks!
